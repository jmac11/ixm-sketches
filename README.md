This is my adventure in writing software for the [Illuminato x Machina](http://illuminatolabs.com/IlluminatoXMachina.htm).

The IXM is an interesting platform, taking the limits of a [von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and twisting them by adding additional, closely connected computation units. Basically giving you a tiny network of computers that are self aware, robust, and viral (in a sense). It behaves similar to an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) in that it has a bootloader which is programmable through a USB/Serial connection. It can communicate on each of it's four sides and provide small visual feedback with LEDs on each edge and a centrally located RGB LED.

I picked up a [Comp Sci Hack Pack](http://www.liquidware.com/shop/show/CS-HP/Comp+Sci+Hack+Pack), which includes a red programming terminal and 3 IXM cells. This allows for some parallel computations and other interesting experiments.

The files contained below are compilable and executable on each IXM cell.
